- *Breakouts will happen after a big merge / feature / important code chunk
- *Important to remember to both get outside and feed yourself every day. This is

periods.

##  Agreements // Expectations
-
-	-Communicate with the group. Everyone needs to know what is going on in order to 
work effectively as a team. This goes for stress levels, blocks, needs, long 
breaks etc. Scrums and check ins are scheduled times to speak to where you're at, 
otherwise use the slack group, speak with people individually or on an as needs 
basis. Use your judgement and keep others in the loop if your actions will affect 
them.
-	-Asking for help. Ask for help from team mates or teachers before the problem 
becomes too large, taxing or time consuming. This goes for both personal and 
coding issues.
-	-Face conflict and tension if it arises. Get a mediator if necessary but don't 
avoid conversations if they are asked for. It is fine to schedule a time rather 
than talk about it immediately.
-	-Do what you say you will, communicate if you can't do the thing so others aren't 
relying on work that never comes.
-	-Self responsibility, others will check in on you and fill whichever needs they can, 
but ultimately it is up to you to ensure you are looking after yourself, having breaks, 
practicing self empathy and managing your own workflow.
-
-	-MVP by Saturday latest
-	-Pair programming so everyone is at least learning if they don't have a task, general 
plan is to pair until the mvp is done then split into design / mechanical / stretch.
-
-	-Be on time, and show up for each other.
-	-Respect each other, remain kind, listen to each other, have fun learning new stuff.
-	-No judgement on anyone's needs or opinions. We are cultivating a safe space for 
everyone in this team.
-
-
## Needs && Wellbeing
-
-	-Later start time to help those that need to commute, also not everyone has time to 
complete code in the evenings because of the commute.
-	-Understand MVD as a concept (minimum viable day), if someone communicates they 
need to be having a MVD, don't expect them them to be at full or even half capacity.
-	-If a team member is having a bad day, it is perfectly okay for them to just do what 
they can, even if it means doing nothing and just being present for the day and the 
meetings.
-	-Human skills facilitators are always around for chats
-	-If someone is having a bad time but you need information out of them, let them know 
the importance and perhaps schedule a time to talk about it.
-
-	*Ricki-Jane has requested to be able to choose tasks that fit her best, and to be given 
given manageable work and autonomy over who she pairs with. If she is having space 
from coding, she would still like to be invited to join from time to time. Asking 
how she is / what she needs has an adverse affect when she doesn't feel capable 
of communicating, so with these understandings in mind, let her come to you and leave 
her be. 
-
-
-	-Have group lunches where we don't talk about code & can relax
-	-Basics, eat, don't just survive on coffee, get outside, move your body, rest your mind.
